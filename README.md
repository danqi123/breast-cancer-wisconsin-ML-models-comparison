## Introduction to ML tutorial



* Built ML models including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, K-NN, SVM, etc. to predict disease classification.
* Checked data balance, preprocessed the data with dimensionality reduction (PCA) for Logistic Regression, K-NN and SVM, and improved model performance via K-fold cross validation hyperparameter tuning.
* Gradient Boosting and Random Forest models achieved highest performance, i.e. Accuracy reached to 0.98, and F1 score was 0.96.
* Performed feature importance via Random Forest model. 
* Uniformity of cell shape, bare nuclei and uniformity of cell size ranked at top three.
